Please note that this is a test project to exercise Java GUI development. This is a clicker game. Click the strawberry to collect it. Each click has a small chance to get 4 more strawberries. If you get 4 more strawberries, you cannot gain any more. Follow these steps to try out the game:

1. Download strawberry.zip
2. Unzip it to a location of your choice
3. Open strawberry.jar

Warning! This app has only been tested on Windows. I don't guarantee that it will run perfectly on Linux. Java source files are included in the JAR file.
